##How to Update All Python Packages
The following works on linux

Do

$ pip freeze > requirements.txt

Open the text file, replace the == with >=, or have sed do it for you:

$ sed -i 's/==/>=/g' requirements.txt

and execute:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

If you have a problem with a certain package stalling the upgrade (NumPy sometimes), just go to the directory ($),
comment out the name (add a # before it) and run the upgrade again. You can later uncomment that section back. 
This is also great for copying Python global environments.
