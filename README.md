# running_scripts_in_python
scripts in other language/softwares ran in python.

Every software has its own advantages. For example, python is very is when it comes to calculation, handling multiple files
or lets say defining a function. ForTran is much faster in terms of calculation, execution of a program. Ferret on the other hand,
can do both, and also, saving files with same attributes as the original file as compared to python, where we've to specify the 
coordinates, attributes etc, there by ferret saves a lot of time and effort.

This repo is to show case how scripts from other softwares/programming language can be called through python scripts, so as to have 
best of every world. flexibility of python + reliability of Ferret + computational feasibility of Fortran.

# by extension, more useful scripts are added henceforth june/09/23
